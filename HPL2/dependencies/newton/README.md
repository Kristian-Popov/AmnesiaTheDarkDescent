This folder contains modified version of Newton Dynamics library.

Check out:
* [newtondynamics.com website](http://newtondynamics.com/forum/newton.php)
* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics)
* Older versions can be found on [Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/newton-dynamics/downloads).

Differences against main distribution of Newton 2.31:
* Removed unused *applications*, *packages* folders
* Compilation fixes and backports for newer Newton versions, often based on [brynet's port](https://github.com/brynet/Amnesia64). Individual fixes to source code should be marked with big noticeable comments
* Added CMake build file for Linux
